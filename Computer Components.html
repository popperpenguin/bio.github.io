	<h1>  Components of a Computer </h1>
	<img src='Slide 1.jpg'  alt='Components' width='400px' height='400px'>
	<p> This photo explains the basic on how a pc runs.
		You need to connect an input device into the computer 
		that holds the CPU and the Memory. Once you 
		plug in the input into the PC, it would
		show the on the monitor to and that would
		be the output device. 
	</p>
	
	<h1> Inputs </h1>
	<h2> Keyboard </h2>
	<img src='Keyboard.jpg'  alt='Components' width='400px' height='200px'> 
	<p> This is one of the most important input that a computer needs.
		A keyboard allows people to type anything they want onto a 
		search engine. They can search anything they want and they
		can use the keyboard to play games.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Ball Mouse </h3>
	<img src='Ball mouse.jpg'  alt='Components' width='400px' height='400px'>
	<p> This is another important input. This input device is operated 
		by rolling its ball across a flat surface. The mouse is used to 
		control the on screen pointer by pointing, clicking, double clicking,
		or dragging objects on the screen.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Optical Mouse </h3>
	<img src='Optical mouse.jpg'  alt='Components' width='400px' height='400px'>
	<p> This is another mouse that people use. This mouse is an advanced computer pointing 
		device. It usses Light-Emitting Diode (LED) in place of the traditional mouse ball.
		Movement is detected by sensig changes in reflected light.
	</p>
	
	<h1> Output Devices </h1>
	<h3> Monitor </h3>
	<img src='Monitor.jpg'  alt='Components' width='400px' height='400px'>
	<p> A monitor is a display screen that is used to provide "output" 
		to the user. It is where you can view the information 
		you are working on.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Printer </h3>
	<img src='Printer.jpg'  alt='Components' width='400px' height='400px'>
	<p> This is an output device that produces a hard of the information.
		Information to the user that is in printed form.
	</p>
	
	<h1> Memory/Storage Devices </h1>
	<h3> Primary Memory </h3>
	<img src='Primary types.jpg'  alt='Components' width='400px' height='200px'>
	<ul> Temporary area for holding data </ul>
	<ul> To store the program currently being executed </ul>
	<ul> To hold data produced while the program is running </ul>
	
	<h3> Ram (Random  Access Memory </h3>
	<img src='RAM.jpg'  alt='Components' width='400px' height='200px'>
	<ul> Major portion of the Primary Memory </ul>
	<ul> Memory that is used by the program in execution </ul>
	<ul> If the computer gets turned off, RAM will lose all the data </ul>
	
	<h3> Static RAM </h3>
	<img src='Static RAM.jpg'  alt='Components' width='400px' height='200px'>
	<ul> The memory retains as long as power remains </ul>
	<ul> Uses Flip Flop circuitory </ul>
	<ul> Its more faster </ul>
	
	<h3> Dynamic RAM </h3>
	<img src='Dynamic RAM.jpg'  alt='Components' width='400px' height='200px'>
	<ul> Need continues Refreshing in order to maintain the data </ul>
	<ul> It uses transistors and capacitors in circuits </ul>
	<ul> Slow and consumes more power </ul>
